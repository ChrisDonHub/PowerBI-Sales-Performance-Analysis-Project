This project is designed to give executives, stakeholders, and senior leadership a 360° view of sales performance, budget alignment, and year-on-year (YoY) trends; helping them make clearer, faster, and more confident decisions. 

The workflow began with raw data moving through three key cleaning stages: manipulation, validation, and normalization, ensuring accuracy and consistency before any analysis. 

I leveraged Excel, Power Query, SQL, and finally Power BI (for both DAX and visualization) to transform the data into actionable insights. 

The solution is delivered through a focused two-page Power BI report: 

1.) Executive Summary: a high-level view for leadership to quickly understand overall performance. 

2.) Regional Analysis: a deeper dive into how different regions and channels are performing, and where opportunities or risks lie. 

Key visuals and metrics include: 

i.) Store sales by product (gross profit) 
ii.) Sales contribution by channel 
iii.) Regional performance narrative 
iv.) Store sales performance summary 
v.) FY sales vs prior year and budget 
vi. ) Gross profit by region 
vii.) 21 DAX measures, including: FY sales, FY gross profit, FY total units sold, FY transaction count, FY average transaction value, and more 
viii.) Interactive filters for region, product, and calendar month to support flexible, self-service exploration 

This project has significantly strengthened my skills in data cleaning, SQL querying, DAX modeling, and storytelling with Power BI, and has reinforced how well-designed dashboards can help business leaders see past the noise and focus on what truly matters. 

A heartfelt thank you to Michael Oladapo Soetan for his guidance, mentorship, and support throughout this project. His teaching played a key role in deepening my data analysis capabilities. 

If you’d like to see the report layout or discuss the approach, I’d be happy to connect and share more.
