**POWERBI SALES PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS PROJECT**

**Proiect Overview**

This proiect simulates a real-world commercial sales analvtics engagement where a Data Analyst is tasked with delivering executive-level insights into sales performance across regions. stores, products. and sales channels. Using Power BI, the project focuses on analysing current-year sales, budget alignment, and year- on-vear performance, enabling business leaders to quickly understand where the business is winning, underperforming, or at risk. The final deliverable is an interactive Power B dashboard designed for decision-makers, with clear KPIs, drill-down capabilities, and dynamic narratives that explain what is happening and why.

**Business Obiectives**

The purpose of this proiect is to support commercial and strategic decision-making by answering key business questions such as:
1.) Are we meeting our sales targets? • How does current performance compare to last vear? ◦ Which regions, stores, and channels are driving or dragging performance? ◦ Are sales changes driven by volume, price, or customer behaviour?
Target Audience
2.) Executives & Senior Leadership
3.) Regional & Store Managers
4.) Commercial & Finance Teams

**Decisions Enabled**

1.) Resource reallocation across regions or stores • Channel investment decisions (online Vs physical)
2.) Performance management and forecasting DATASET
3.) Check the exercise files for the project Dataset

This project is designed to give executives, stakeholders, and senior leadership a 360° view of sales performance, budget alignment, and year-on-year (YoY) trends; helping them make clearer, faster, and more confident decisions. 

**Stages, Tools Used and Outcome**

The workflow began with raw data moving through three key cleaning stages: manipulation, validation, and normalization, ensuring accuracy and consistency before any analysis. I leveraged Excel, Power Query, SQL, and finally Power BI (for both DAX and visualization) to transform the data into actionable insights. The solution is delivered through a focused two-page Power BI report: 

1.) Executive Summary: a high-level view for leadership to quickly understand overall performance. 
2.) Regional Analysis: a deeper dive into how different regions and channels are performing, and where opportunities or risks lie. 

**Key Visuals and Metrics**

i.) Store sales by product (gross profit) 
ii.) Sales contribution by channel 
iii.) Regional performance narrative 
iv.) Store sales performance summary 
v.) FY sales vs prior year and budget 
vi. ) Gross profit by region 
vii.) 21 DAX measures, including: FY sales, FY gross profit, FY total units sold, FY transaction count, FY average transaction value, and more 
viii.) Interactive filters for region, product, and calendar month to support flexible, self-service exploration 

This project has significantly strengthened my skills in data cleaning, SQL querying, DAX modeling, and storytelling with Power BI, and has reinforced how well-designed dashboards can help business leaders see past the noise and focus on what truly matters. 

A heartfelt thank you to ***Michael Oladapo Soetan*** for his guidance, mentorship, and support throughout this project. His teaching played a key role in deepening my data analysis capabilities. 

**Key Takeaways and Learning Outcomes**

1.) Clean, transform, and validate raw sales and budqet data from multiple sources to ensure accuracy and consistency
2.) Design and implement a star schema data model with fact and dimension tables for efficient analvtics.
3.) Develop advanced DAX measures for sales budget variance, and year-on-year performance analysis.
4.) Understand and apply core retail business metrics, including basket size, transaction value, channel mix, and profitability.
5.) Build executive-level Power BI dashboards with drill-down, slicers, and intuitive navigation.
6.) Translate analytical results into business insights using dynamic narratives that explain performance drivers and trends.
